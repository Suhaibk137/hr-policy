                    <h4>4.2.1 Start Time (Work from Home)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Official Start Time:</strong> All employees must commence their workday by 10:00 AM.</p>

                    <h4>4.2.2 Morning Meetings</h4>
                    <p><strong>Mandatory Attendance:</strong> Attendance at the daily morning meeting is mandatory for all employees.</p>
                    <p><strong>Reporting Delays:</strong> If an employee is unable to start work by 10:00 AM, they must inform their immediate superior before the start time, providing a valid reason for the delay. Valid reasons may include medical emergencies, transportation issues, or other unforeseen circumstances. Failure to notify in advance may result in disciplinary action, including deductions in pay as outlined below.</p>

                    <h4>4.2.3 Work Hours</h4>
                    <p><strong>Flexible Work Hours:</strong> Elite Resumes does not enforce a fixed number of working hours per day. Instead, employees are expected to complete their daily assigned tasks within the workday.</p>
                    <p><strong>Task Completion Responsibility:</strong> Employees are responsible for managing their time effectively to ensure that all assigned tasks are completed by the end of the workday.</p>
                    <p><strong>Consequences of Non-Completion:</strong> Failure to deliver assigned tasks may result in a deduction of half a day's pay. Continuous inability to meet task deadlines may lead to further disciplinary actions, including potential termination.</p>

                    <p><strong>Communication Platforms:</strong> Employees must remain available on WhatsApp during designated work hours for communication, collaboration, and task updates.</p>
                    <p><strong>Availability Requirements:</strong> Employees should not be unavailable for more than 30 minutes during work hours without prior notification. If an employee anticipates being unavailable, they must notify their higher official in advance, providing a valid reason.</p>
                    <p><strong>Emergency Situations:</strong> In unforeseen emergencies, employees should inform their higher official as soon as possible.</p>
                    <p><strong>Consequences of Unavailability:</strong> Being unavailable for more than 30 minutes without prior notification may result in a deduction of half a day's pay or a full day's pay loss, depending on the severity and frequency of the unavailability.</p>

                    <h4>4.2.5 Power Outages, Connectivity Issues, and Technical Difficulties</h4>
                    <p><strong>Preparedness Requirement:</strong> All employees working remotely must ensure their devices, including phones and laptops, are fully charged before starting the workday to minimize disruption during potential power outages.</p>
                    <p><strong>Reporting Technical Issues:</strong> In the event of a power outage, connectivity issue, or other technical difficulties that prevent an employee from performing their duties, they must immediately inform their immediate superior or designated contact via phone or any other available means.</p>
                    <p><strong>Leave Application for Extended Disruptions:</strong> If the issue persists and the employee is unable to resume work for a significant portion of the work period, they must apply for leave for the time lost. Failure to do so may result in deductions from pay as outlined in the company's attendance policy.</p>
                    <p><strong>Documentation of Issues:</strong> Employees may be required to provide documentation or details regarding the nature of the technical issue (e.g., power outage notices, screenshots of network issues) to support their leave request.</p>
